This is a readme for this project and how to run the code for evaluation

# Accessing Data
All of the code is in the form of Colab Notebooks, and all of the data (>100 GB) is hosted on my Google Drive. The folder is called "Cadenza Challenge"
I'll have shared a link to the Google Drive folder with you, you'll need to accept that link. Then, you'll need to go to "Shared With Me" in your google drive, right-click on the shared folder, select 
Organize->Create Shortcut->     Place that shortcut somewhere in your Drive, ideally, in the MyDrive location.

Then, all you have to do is run the Colab files as is (and Mount *your* GDrive - the code already does that) and you'll be able to run everything. And you'll have access to all the data.


# Prerequisites
The Colab notebooks will import anything required, so you can just hit run all cells and verify it all.

However, one primary / critical import is Pyclarity : https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity/tree/main
I install it in every notebook as !pip install pyclarity==0.4.0 

This version was suggested by the challenge creators, so leave that unchanged.


# Files to run

Although all of the files are relevant, there are a few duplicates, so run the following and all of the project should make sense. The suggested order should make sense, but you don't have to follow it!
